## Analyzing and Visualizing Interaction Energies with GROMACS and Gnuplot

This section explains how to analyze interaction energies from GROMACS simulation data and visualize them using Gnuplot.

### Step 1: Analyze Interaction Energy Data
Use the following command to analyze the interaction energy data and calculate the autocorrelation function:

```bash
gmx_mpi analyze -f interaction_energy.xvg -ac

gnuplot -e "
set terminal png size 800,600;
set output 'interactionenergy_with_reference.png';
set title 'Energy vs Time';
set xlabel 'Time (ps)';
set ylabel 'Energy (kJ/mol)';
set grid;
plot 'interaction_energy.xvg' using 1:2 with lines title 'Pressure' linecolor rgb 'purple', \
     'interaction_energy.xvg' using 1:2 smooth sbezier with lines title '10-ps Running Avg' linecolor rgb 'red';"

Explanation of the Plot
Input File: interaction_energy.xvg
Output File: interactionenergy_with_reference.png
Graph Details:
X-Axis: Time (ps)
Y-Axis: Energy (kJ/mol)
Grid: Added for better readability.
Purple Line: Raw interaction energy data.
Red Line: Smoothed data showing a 10-ps running average using Bezier smoothing.
Example Output:
After running the above Gnuplot command, the output will look something like this:


Notes
Make sure you have Gnuplot installed on your system.
Ensure the file interaction_energy.xvg is in the working directory before running these commands.
